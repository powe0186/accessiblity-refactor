For better semantic markup:

changed the <div> with id="header" to a <header>.
changed the <div> with class="benefits" to an <aside>
changed the <div> with class="content" to a <main>
changed the footer div to be a <footer>

Images:
Fixed links for images and added alt="" on all of them for accessibility.

fixed first in-page link in the header by adding an id attribute.

Removed redundancies in css for the <aside> bar by creating one shared class.
Removed redundancies in <main> by making one class for the three sections.

Changed the three main divs to <section>s

Gave the <title> tag a better descriptor to help with online searches.
